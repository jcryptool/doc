JCrypTool Doc
=======

The **JCrypTool Doc** project contains all available JCrypTool documentation like the **Getting started with JCrypTool** guide and other useful information for (crypto) plug-in development.

Have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki) for more information on how to get you started as a JCrypTool developer. Feel free to ask any question you might have in our [developers group](http://groups.google.com/group/jcryptool-developers).

JCrypTool downloads are available as [weekly builds](https://github.com/jcryptool/core/releases) (unstable, built automatically based on the **develop** branch) and as [release builds](https://www.cryptool.org/en/jct-downloads/jct-stable) (stable).

General information on the CrypTool and JCrypTool projects is available in the [CrypTool](http://www.cryptool.org) portal.
